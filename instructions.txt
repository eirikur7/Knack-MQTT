This code base lets the user press "wasd" keys and sent the data
to a cloud base which a subscriber can connect to and receive data
with minimal bandwidth. Paho MQTT is designed to be used with lightweight IOT devices,
so they can work with minimal delay and bandwidth.

Publisher:
    Run publisher on the source computer. The script will send keyboard data to the cloud via MQTT.

Subscriber:
    Run subscriber on the sink computer. The script will receive data from the cloud via MQTT

For the future:
    It is possible to make the subscriber know when it disconnects in case of bad internet.
    Which means it is possible to make the rover stop if it disconnects instead of it going
    forwards indefinitely.

How to run:
    On the source computer.
        Run "sudo pip install -r requirements"
        Run publisher.py

    On the sink computer.
        Run "sudo pip install -r requirements"
        Run subscriber.py
